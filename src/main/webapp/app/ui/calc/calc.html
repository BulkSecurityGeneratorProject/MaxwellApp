                The body mass index (BMI) or Quetelet index is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual.
                The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally
                expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.

                Water is your body's principal chemical component and makes up about 60 percent of your body weight. Every system in your body depends on water. For example, water flushes toxins out of vital organs, carries nutrients to your cells, and provides a moist environment for ear, nose and throat tissues.
                Lack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry out normal functions. Even mild dehydration can drain your energy and make you tired.
                <h4>How much water do you need?</h4>
                Every day you lose water through your breath, perspiration, urine and bowel movements. For your body to function properly, you must replenish its water supply by consuming beverages and foods that contain water.
                So how much fluid does the average, healthy adult living in a temperate climate need? The Institute of Medicine determined that an adequate intake (AI) for men is roughly about 13 cups (3 liters) of total beverages a day. The AI for women is about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of total beverages a day.

                Waist–hip ratio or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is the ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips. This is calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement (W ÷ H). For example, a person with a 25″ (64 cm) waist and 38″ (97 cm) hips has a waist–hip ratio of about 0.66.
                The WHR has been used as an indicator or measure of health, and the risk of developing serious health conditions. WHR correlates with fertility (with different optimal values for males and females). Some researchers have found that the waist-hip ratio is a significant measure of female attractiveness.

                Ideal body weight (IBW) was initially introduced by Devine in 1974 to allow estimation of drug clearances in obese patients researchers have since shown that the metabolism of certain drugs relates more to IBW than total body weight. The term was based on the use of
                insurance data that demonstrated the relative mortality for males and females according to different height–weight combinations.

                Proteins are essential nutrients for the human body. They are one of the building blocks of body tissue, and can also serve as a fuel source. As a fuel, proteins contain 4 kcal (17 kJ) per gram, just like carbohydrates and unlike lipids, which contain 9 kcal (37 kJ) per gram. The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from
                a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid composition.
